Video-Analysis-using-OpenCV
===========================

This repository consists of code of code for detection of parking lots using OpenCV. The
method used here is Contour extraction. Note that parking lots are the biggest rectangles 
in our region of interest in the image. So after the contours of the objects in the image
have been extracted, it is determined if the contours form a rectangle or not.
